    <p>This contains images of the games I am playing.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><h2><img src="images/GI.jpg" width="120"> Genshin Impact</h2></li>
        <p>This is the first video game from <a href="https://www.hoyoverse.com/en-us/" target="_blank"> Hoyoverse</a> that I am playing.</p>
        <img src="images/GIposter.jpg" width="300">
        <p>This is one of its game posters which shows the characters you will meet at the beginning of the story. Its an amazing
            open-world adventure game with interesting lore about twin siblings that were separated and is on
            journer to find the truth about the world and be reunited.</p>
        <li><h2><img src="images/HSR.jpg" width="120"> Honkai Star Rail</h2></li>
        <p>Another video game from <a href="https://www.hoyoverse.com/en-us/" target="_blank"> Hoyoverse</a>. I am also currenly playing this one.</p>
        <img src="images/HSRposter.jpg" width="300">
        <p>This is a newly released game from them. It is somehow related to another game from them, Honkai Impact 3rd, its predecessor that I also played a bit. The 
            lore is quite engaging and it involves space travelling, from one planet to another. Some characters from Honkai Impact 3rd made an 
            appearance here, some are even playable.</p>
        <li><h2><img src="images/HK.jpg" width="170"> Hollow Knight</h2></li>
        <p>A video game by team cherry, <a href="https://www.hollowknight.com/" target="_blank"> Hollow Knight</a>. I played the unofficial game of this because I cannot afford 
            to buy the official one.</p>
        <img src="images/HKmc.gif" width="300">
        <p>This is a very cute game about a beetle or some kind of insect on the journey to unravel the mystery of the ancient kingdom beneath the fading town of Dirtmouth.
            It has an amazing gameplay and cute characters. The level design is also interesting and the music is spectacular. Every part of the game is a work of art. It has 
            an upcoming game called The Silksong where the protagonist is someone from Hollow Knight. </p>
